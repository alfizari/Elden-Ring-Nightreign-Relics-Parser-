# Elden Ring Nightreign Relics Parser

A simple Python tool to **parse relics from Elden Ring save files**.

> **Note:** Currently supports **PC save files only**.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
2. Run the parser script:

```bash
python parser.py
```

3. The script will prompt you to:

   * Enter the **path to your save file**.
   * Enter the **character name**.

4. The relics associated with that character will be displayed in the terminal.

## Features

* Works exclusively with PC saves; PS4 saves are not supported.
